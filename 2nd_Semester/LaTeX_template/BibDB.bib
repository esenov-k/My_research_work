  abstract     = {Since its inception in 2015, the YOLO (You Only Look Once) variant of object detectors has rapidly grown, with the latest release of YOLO-v8 in January 2023. YOLO variants are underpinned by the principle of real-time and high-classification performance, based on limited but efficient computational parameters. This principle has been found within the DNA of all YOLO variants with increasing intensity, as the variants evolve addressing the requirements of automated quality inspection within the industrial surface defect detection domain, such as the need for fast detection, high accuracy, and deployment onto constrained edge devices. This paper is the first to provide an in-depth review of the YOLO evolution from the original YOLO to the recent release (YOLO-v8) from the perspective of industrial manufacturing. The review explores the key architectural advancements proposed at each iteration, followed by examples of industrial deployment for surface defect detection endorsing its compatibility with industrial requirements.},
